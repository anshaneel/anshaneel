### Hi there 👋

<!--
**anshaneel/anshaneel** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a cool startup and some interesting LLM research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about genetic algorithms and non-fixed topology Neural Networks
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are impactful to the general population
- 💬 Ask me about anything! (I like to read papers give me some good recommendations)
